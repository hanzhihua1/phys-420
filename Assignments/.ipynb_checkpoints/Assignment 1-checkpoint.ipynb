    "4.  One way to lose accuracy in calculating derivatives is that, because the way numbers in the computer are represented $$(x+h)-(x-h) \\neq 2h$$- and so the denominator in the derivative calculation is not actually the difference between the values at which the function is calculated.  We can get around this by using *exactly representable numbers.*  This works by defining $x_1=x-h, x_2=x+h$ and then calculating $$f'(x)\\approx\\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}.$$  This works because $x_1$ and $x_2$ exactly represent some numbers- and so we calculate the exact difference for those numbers.\n",

    "5.  Typically, the precision of physics measurements is a bigger effect than numerical approximation in representing quantities.  We can quantify this, at least for statistical uncertainties, using a random number generator.  Suppose we have data from measurements of a sine wave with noise.  We model this with a function $$d(t)=\\sin(t)+a_n R,$$ where $R$ is a random number drawn from a gaussian distribution with $\\sigma=1.0$ and $a_n$ is the size of the noise.  (with numpy you can generate such random numbers with numpy.random.randn())\n",
